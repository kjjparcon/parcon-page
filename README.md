Hi reader! I am Kaye Janiecka Parcon, a student in Palawan State University taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, currently on my 3rd year of college.

I live in Brgy. Mandaragat, Puerto Princesa City and this is where my three lovable dogs reside with us. My hobbies are sleeping, playing both computer and mobile games, singing, and watching movies and series especially anime.

The games I play currently are Genshin Impact, Valorant, Mobile Legends, and Fall Guys, I am also into metroidvania games like Hollow Knight. For the movies, I like to watch horror movies often, and series like Lucifer, Stranger Things, and Umbrella Academy are my cup of tea. My favorite anime this season is Spy x Family, I liked its refreshing genre to watch compared to other oversaturated "isekai" themed shows.
